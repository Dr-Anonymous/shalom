After completing my B.Tech I was looking for a job in well established IT companies but I was unable to find one.
In October 2013 I went to the church and prayed God regarding this issue. I prayed with faith and a sincere heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, one fine day I came to know that one of the MNC company (Syntel, CHENNAI) was hiring fresh graduates and I applied for that. The selection process included four rounds.
First round was written test. In that round I really  felt nervous but I prayed God before going to the exam and when I started looking at the question paper, most of the questions were  from the book which I prepared in that week. This was really a miracle that happened by God’s grace.
And the third round was technical round where they interview us. In this round they were selecting people mostly from CSE and IT background but I am from EEE. I got nervous before going to that round but I prayed to God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was about to enter the TR panel room two persons from Andhra joined the interview committee.
They asked me only the questions I know about C language and  about my subjects. After they interviewed me, they left the interview panel leaving the other candidate to the remaining panel members.I think God has sent them only to interview me. Finally I cleared that round and I also cleared my final round with confidence given by God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 3 days from the interview date, I got the offer letter from the company that I was selected.
I even got the joining letter within 20 days and I joined the company and I’m really happy with my job.
All this happened to me when I started believing in Jesus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank God and the church who prayed and supported me.</p></div></div></div><!-- Footer -->
